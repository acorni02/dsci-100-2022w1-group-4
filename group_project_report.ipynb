    "Introduction:\n",
    "As of 2020, heart disease was one of the most leading factors contributing to death worldwide. The most common cause of heart disease is a buildup of fatty plaques in the arteries. Risk factors for heart disease include a poor diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and smoking. Symptoms of heart disease include rapid heart rate, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Gaining an acuurate and useful diagnosis from a doctor can be quite tedious and time consuming. A digital classifier could help speed up the process of diagnosis and decrease possible risks to health. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question we will be adressing is; What variables can be used to accurately predict whether or not someone likely has heart disease, or is at risk for heart disease? {IS THIS ACCURATE, DO WE HAVE A NEW QUESTION?}\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set that will be used is \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data\" and it contains 14 attributes which state the quantitative variables that are of interest in regard to heart disease factors: \n",
    "- 1. age: age in years\n",
    "- 2. sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)\n",
    "- 3. cp: chest pain type \n",
    "- 4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)\n",
    "- 5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "- 6. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)\n",
    "- 7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "- 8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "- 9. exang: exercise induced angina\n",
    "- 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "- 11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "- 12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
    "- 13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect\n",
    "- 14. num: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)"
